            ## Task:
            You are given four inputs:

            1. An original query.
            2. The semantically parsed version of the original query.
            3. A candidate basic question
            4. The result of the basic question (expressed in logical representation form).
            Your task is to determine whether the basic question and its result can fully or partially solve the original query and parsed query. 
            If they can, transform both the original query and the parsed query using the result from the basic question. If they cannot, or if the prerequisites for solving the query are not met, output "No" in the result.



            ## Instructions:
            Check Compatibility: Verify if the basic question and its result can solve the original query and its parsed version.

            Determine the Type of Solution:

            - If the basic question fully solves the query, mark it as "fully solved".
            - If the basic question only partially solves the query, mark it as "partially solved".
            - If the basic question does not help solve any part of the query, mark it as "no solution".
            
            Provide Results:

            - If the basic question fully solves the query, transform both the original and parsed queries based on the result.
            - If the basic question partially solves the query, reduce both queries using the basic question, e.g. modify the part of the query that can be solved, and leave the rest unchanged, or you can rewrite it. The rewrite rules are as follows:
                - If sub-problems are needed:
                    - Set "transformed_original_query" to exact string "sub_problems"
                    - Define sub-problems list in "sub_problems" field
                - If no sub-problems needed:
                    - reduce the query directly and set "sub_problems" to "No".
            If the basic question does not solve any part of the query, return "No" for both the original and parsed queries.


            ## Output:

            Return a JSON object in the following format:
            {{
                "fully_solved": <true/false>,
                "partially_solved": <true/false>,
                "transformed_original_query": "<transformed original query | sub_problems>",
                "sub_problems": "<list of sub-queries | No>",
                "transformed_parsed_query": "<transformed parsed query>"
            }}

            ## Detailed Scenarios:
            ### Fully Solved:

            The basic question completely solves the original and parsed queries.
                - Set "fully_solved" to true, "partially_solved" to false.
                - Provide the transformed versions of both the original and parsed queries.


            ### Partially Solved:

            The basic question solves part of the original and parsed queries.
                - Set "fully_solved" to false, "partially_solved" to true.
                - Provide the transformed versions of both the original and parsed queries, reflecting only the part that can be solved.


            ### Not solved:

            The basic question does not help solve any part of the query.
                - Set "fully_solved" and "partially_solved" to false.
                - Set "transformed_original_query" and "transformed_parsed_query" to "No".

            ## Examples:
            {examples_str}

            
            Now, for the current input:

            Original Query: "{original_question}"
            Semantic Parsed Query: "{parsed_question}"
            Candidate Basic Question: "{BQ_Question}"
            Result of the Basic Question: "{BQ_Return}"

            Please provide the result in the JSON format described above like above examples. Do not output any other thing except the JSON.
